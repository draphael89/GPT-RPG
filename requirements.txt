Multi-step form for creating a character
Options for race, class, attributes, skills, and background
Validation and calculation of derived stats
Storage of character data in Firebase

Game Mechanics

Turn-based gameplay
Dice rolling simulation for actions and checks
Experience points and leveling system
Real-time updates using Firebase Realtime Database

Combat System

Initiative-based turn order
Attack rolls and damage calculation
Special abilities and spells
Real-time combat updates for multiplayer potential

Inventory Management

Item pickup and storage
Equipping items and managing character loadout
Item effects on character stats
Syncing inventory data with Firebase

AI-Generated Content Integration

Dynamically generated scene descriptions
AI-driven NPC interactions
Procedurally generated quests and events
Use of Firebase Cloud Functions to interact with OpenAI API

6. State Management
Redux Store Structure
typescriptCopyinterface RootState {
  character: CharacterState;
  game: GameState;
  inventory: InventoryState;
}
Key Actions and Reducers

updateCharacter: Update character stats and info
startCombat: Initialize combat state
performAction: Execute a game action (attack, use item, etc.)
addToInventory: Add an item to the character's inventory
generateScene: Trigger AI scene generation

State Update Patterns

Use immer for immutable state updates in reducers
Dispatch actions from components using useDispatch hook
Access state in components using useSelector hook
Sync relevant parts of the state with Firebase Realtime Database

7. Firebase Integration
Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore Operations

firebase.database().ref('characters').push(): Create a new character
firebase.database().ref('characters').child(id).once('value'): Retrieve character data
firebase.database().ref('characters').child(id).update(): Update character data
firebase.database().ref('inventory').child(characterId).push(): Add item to inventory
firebase.database().ref('game_sessions').push(): Create a new game session

For Firestore, the operations would be similar but using Firestore syntax.
Cloud Functions

exports.generateAIContent = functions.https.onCall((data, context) => { ... }): Generate AI content
exports.processCombatRound = functions.https.onCall((data, context) => { ... }): Process a round of combat

Authentication

firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password): Create a new user
firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password): Sign in a user
firebase.auth().signOut(): Sign out the current user

8. Database Schema
Collections (Firestore) / Nodes (Realtime Database)

Users

userId (string)
email (string)
displayName (string)
createdAt (timestamp)


Characters

characterId (string)
userId (string)
name (string)
race (string)
class (string)
level (number)
attributes (object)
skills (object)
hitPoints (number)
experience (number)


Inventory

inventoryId (string)
characterId (string)
items (array of objects)


GameSessions

sessionId (string)
characterId (string)
currentScene (string)
timestamp (timestamp)



Relationships

Users have many Characters (one-to-many)
Characters have one Inventory (one-to-one)
GameSessions belong to one Character (many-to-one)

Indexing Strategy

For Firestore, create composite indexes for complex queries (e.g., characters by user and level)
For Realtime Database, structure data to allow for efficient querying (e.g., nesting inventory under characters)

9. AI Integration
OpenAI API Usage

Use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 for text generation
Use DALL-E for image generation (if applicable)

Prompt Engineering Guidelines

Craft specific prompts for different types of content (scenes, dialogues, item descriptions)
Include relevant context from the game state in prompts
Use temperature and top_p parameters to control creativity vs. consistency

Error Handling and Fallback Strategies

Implement retry logic for API failures
Have pre-generated fallback content for AI failures
Log AI errors for review and prompt improvement

10. User Interface
Component Hierarchy
CopyLayout
├── Navigation
├── CharacterSheet
├── GameScreen
│   ├── SceneDescription
│   ├── ActionMenu
│   └── CombatInterface
└── Inventory
Styling Approach

Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design
Create custom components for reusable UI elements
Use CSS modules for component-specific styles

Responsive Design Considerations

Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
Implement a mobile-first design approach
Use flexbox and grid for layout flexibility

11. Static vs. Server Rendering
Static Rendering (SSG - Static Site Generation)
Use for:

Home page
Character creation guide
Game rules and documentation
Any content that doesn't require personalization or real-time data

Implementation:

Use getStaticProps for data fetching at build time
Use getStaticPaths for generating static pages with dynamic routes

Example:
typescriptCopyexport async function getStaticProps() {
  const rulesContent = await fetchGameRules();
  return { props: { rulesContent } };
}
Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Use for:

Character sheet display (personalized, but not real-time)
Initial game state loading
Any page that needs SEO benefits but has user-specific content

Implementation:

Use getServerSideProps for data fetching at request time

Example:
typescriptCopyexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const session = await getSession(context);
  const character = await fetchCharacter(session.user.id);
  return { props: { character } };
}
Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
Use for:

Active gameplay screens
Inventory management
Any feature requiring real-time updates or frequent user interactions

Implementation:

Use React hooks and Firebase SDK for real-time data fetching and updates

Example:
typescriptCopyconst GameScreen: React.FC = () => {
  const [gameState, setGameState] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const gameRef = firebase.database().ref('games/' + gameId);
    gameRef.on('value', (snapshot) => {
      setGameState(snapshot.val());
    });
    return () => gameRef.off();
  }, [gameId]);

  // Render game UI using gameState
};
Decision Criteria

Static Rendering: Use for content that is the same for all users and doesn't change frequently.
Server-Side Rendering: Use for personalized content that needs SEO or initial fast load times.
Client-Side Rendering: Use for highly interactive features or real-time data.

12. Security Considerations
Authentication Implementation

Use Firebase Authentication for user management
Implement OAuth 2.0 for third-party login (Google, Facebook, etc.) using Firebase Auth providers
Firebase handles password hashing and storage securely

Data Encryption

Use HTTPS for all client-server communication (enabled by default with Firebase)
Firebase encrypts data at rest in its databases
Use environment variables for storing API keys and secrets

API Security

Implement Firebase Security Rules to control read/write access to your database
Use Firebase App Check to protect your backend resources
Validate and sanitize all user inputs on the client-side and in Cloud Functions

13. Performance Optimization
Caching Strategies

Utilize Firebase offline persistence for caching data locally
Use Next.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for semi-static pages
Implement client-side caching strategies using Firebase SDK's caching capabilities

Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

Use Next.js dynamic imports for code splitting
Implement lazy loading for images and heavy components
Utilize React.Suspense for loading states

Database Query Optimization

Structure data in Firebase for efficient querying
Use Firebase query limitations to prevent excessive data transfer
Implement pagination using Firebase's limitToFirst() and limitToLast() methods
